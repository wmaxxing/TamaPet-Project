<h1> Max Walkleys' Personal Project </h1> 

<h2><strong> Project Proposal <strong></h2>
<p> In CPSC 210 we are required to create a personal project that allows us to show off our learning of java code and have time to develop our programming skills. For this project I am hoping to create a text based pixel art tamagotchi game that will incorperate the following features 

- **Feeding the pet to stave off hunger**
- **Playing with the pet to avoid sadness**
- **History log of all events interacting with the pet and their times** 

As well as counters that provide statistics for the virtual pet and how to keep it alive and thriving! Although these features will depend on time and complexity and may be subject to change. If implementation goes well I will add more events that can interact with the pet! 

This game should appeal to a very general audience and will be made simple enough that anyone who likes playing games and wants to try having a virtual pet on their computer can pick it up without trouble. </p>

<p> This project is of interest to me because I believe that a game would be the best way to show off my skills within this course. In earlier programming courses I have taken at the University of Waterloo we spent time working with a game of snake that was fully played within the terminal using text based drawing and game updates. I think this is a very interesting way to approach game design and will give me the motivation to keep working and be consistent with this project and create a final project that I can be proud to show off to anyone who is interested in the future!</p>
